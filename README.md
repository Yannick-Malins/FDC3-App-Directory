# FDC3-App-Directory

## What Is It?

- This is the FINOS FDC3 2.0 App Directory.
- It contains sample FDC3 applications that you can use with an [FDC3 2.0 Compatible](https://fdc3.finos.org) Desktop Agent.
- This is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which means you can fork it to create your own App Directory.

## Why Is This Important?

üßëüèΩ‚Äçü§ù‚ÄçüßëüèΩ **Get Working Faster**

- FDC3 is a desktop interoperability solution used in the finance industry.   Applications communicate with each other via a "Desktop Agent".
- Multiple Desktop Agent implementations exist, including [FINOS](https://finos.org)' own open source [FDC3 Sail](https://github.com/finos/electron-FDC3).
- If you want to evaluate an FDC3 Desktop Agent then you need a set of compatible applications to test it with, collected in an App Directory (or AppD for short).
- Using (or forking) this repo allows you to shortcut the process of curating your own suite of applications.

‚õÖ **A Showcase**

- FINOS are committed to showcasing the best of the FDC3 community.  What better way to do this than to have your app in the app directory?
- FDC3 is all about interoperability.  It is important to see how the apps work together: sharing context data and user intents between themselves.   For this reason it is valuable to collect the apps together to allow users to see this in action.
